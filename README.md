## Applied-JavaScript-Stretch

**Do NOT work on this project until you have completed MVP and stretch for the daily assignment.**

## Project Description
You are going to be using everything we have learned so far to build a Pomodoro Clock from scratch. This is a stretch project, so you will have to build this from the ground up on your own. Feel free to pair program, or work alone. Style it however you would like, and use any of the tools we have learned- or push yourself to check out new ones! 

## The Pomodoro Technique
Using a timer to break your work into session blocks (usually 25 minutes). Separate these sessions with short breaks (usually 5 minutes). After four consecutive session blocks, take a longer break (usually 20 to 30 minutes).

## MVP Features
* Countdown clock 
* Adjustable session length
* Adjustable break length
* Automatically reset clock to original time after the 4 blocks
* Start, pause, and reset buttons
* Styled using less preprocessor 
* Make the app responsive

## Stretch Feature Ideas
* Sound alert when the work session is over
* Sound alert when the break is over
* Use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) instead of Less
* Record the amount of sessions completed, with a reset button
* Add animations!
